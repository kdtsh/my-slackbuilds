This repository contains some of my own SlackBuilds. Released in the hope that
it will be useful ...

I use an early 2015 MacBook Pro and run Slackware64-current, targetting
Slackware64 15.0 when it is released.

Each of the SlackBuilds have their own licenses. For everything else, the
contents of LICENSE applies.
