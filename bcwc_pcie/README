This SlackBuild builds a package containing the bcwc_pcie driver for
FacetimeHD.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable, as in
  KERNEL=5.10.0 ./bcwc_pcie.SlackBuild

Sensor calibration files are not strictly required, but are useful if
the camera produces incorrect colours. An error like "direct firmware
load for facetimehd/1871_01XX.dat failed with error -2" is normal if
the calibration files have not been installed. See the wiki for
bcwc_pcie for instructions for how to do this.

A comprehensive installation guide is available at
